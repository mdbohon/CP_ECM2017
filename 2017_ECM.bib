abstract = {Structural features resulting from the interaction of a turbulent jet issuing transversely onto a uniform stream are described with the help of flow visualization and hot-wire anemometry. Jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios from 2 to 10 were investigated at crossflow Reynolds numbers from 3800 to 11 400. In particular, the origin and formation of the vortices in the wake are described and shown to be fundamentally different from the well-known phenomenon of vortex shedding from solid bluff bodies. -from Authors},

abstract = {A quasi-two-dimensional, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of a rotating detonation engine (RDE) is described. The simulation operates in the detonation frame of reference and utilizes a relatively coarse grid such that only the essential primary flow field structure is captured. This construction and other simplifications yield rapidly converging, steady solutions. Viscous effects, and heat transfer effects are modeled using source terms. The effects of potential inlet flow reversals are modeled using boundary conditions. Results from the simulation are compared to measured data from an experimental RDE rig with a converging-diverging nozzle added. The comparison is favorable for the two operating points examined. The utility of the code as a performance optimization tool and a diagnostic tool are discussed.

@article{Kamotani1972,
abstract = {Results are reported of experiments on the effects of an opposite wall on the characteristics of turbulent jets injected into a cross flow, for unheated and heated jets. Longitudinal and transverse distributions of velocity and temperature are presented for single and multiple circular jets, and trajectories are presented for two-dimensional jets. The opposite wall has relatively little effect on a single jet unless the ratio of jet to cross flow momentum flux is large enough for the jet to impinge on the opposite wall. For a row of jets aligned perpendicularly to the cross flow, the opposite wall exerts progressively larger influence as the spacing between jets decreases. Much of the effect of jet and wall proximity can be understood by considering the interaction of the vortex flow which is the major feature of the structure of a single jet in a cross flow. Smoke photographs are shown to elucidate some of the interaction patterns.},

@article{Megerian2007,
abstract = {ABSTRACT This study provides a detailed exploration of the near-field shear-layer instabilities associated with a gaseous jet injected normally into crossflow, also known as the transverse jet. Jet injection from nozzles which are flush as well as elevated with respect to the tunnel wall are explored experimentally in this study, for jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios R in the range 1 R 10. The instabilities also exhibit mode shifting downstream along the jet shear layer for either nozzle configuration at these moderately high values of R. When R is reduced below 3.5 in the flush injection experiments, single-mode instabilities are dramatically strengthened, forming almost immediately within the shear layer in addition to harmonic and subharmonic modes, without any evidence of mode shifting. Under these conditions, the dominant and initial mode frequencies tend to decrease with increasing crossflow. In contrast, the instabilities in the elevated jet experiments are weakened as R is reduced below about 4, probably owing to an increase in the vertical coflow magnitude exterior to the elevated nozzle, until R falls below 1.25, at which point the elevated jet instabilities become remarkably similar to those for the flush injected jet. Low-level jet forcing has no appreciable influence on the shear-layer response when these strong modes are present, in contrast to the significant influence of low-level forcing otherwise. These studies suggest profound differences in transverse-jet shear-layer instabilities, depending on the flow regime, and help to explain differences previously observed in transverse jets controlled by strong forcing.},

@article{Anand2016b,
abstract = {The operating range and wave speed performance of a Rotating Detonation Combustor (RDC) is characterized for hydrogen-air mixtures for three fuel injection schemes and two air injection schemes. The fuel injection scheme is altered by changing the total number of injection orifices and the individual orifice area, while maintaining the same fuel mass flux across the three schemes. The operability, performance and combustion-induced pressure rise due to the addition of a back-pressurizing convergent nozzle is also characterized. While the operating range is largely unaffected by changes in the length-to-diameter ratio of the fuel injector orifices, higher length-to-diameter ratios correspond to a lower number of transitional RDC operation where there is a sudden abatement of the continuously propagating detonation wave, once established inside the combustor. Increased air injection area diminishes the operability, while producing high stochasticity in the performance of the RDC. The length-to-diameter ratio of the fuel orifices has a significant impact on the number of detonation waves that can exist in the chamber. For the highest length-to-diameter ratio of the fuel orifices, and at the highest air flow rates, the RDC supports multiple detonation waves inside the chamber. Without the convergent nozzle attachment, 80{\%} of Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) detonation speed is achieved for all three fuel injection schemes. C-J detonation wave speed is achieved in the annulus when the RDC is back-pressurized using the nozzle. The ratio of reactant fill-height to the detonation cell-width tapers at the lean and rich operating conditions, while peaking at an equivalence ratio of around 1.2. The detonation-induced static pressure rise produced in the RDC is found to be dependent on the air flow rate and the equivalence ratio of the reactants.},

@article{Salewski2008,
abstract = {Coherent structures and mixing in the flow field of a jet in crossflow have been studied using computational (large eddy simulation) and experimental (particle image velocimetry and laser-induced fluorescence) techniques. The mean scalar fields and turbulence statistics as determined by both are compared for circular, elliptic, and square nozzles. For the latter configurations, effects of orientation are considered. The computations reveal that the distribution of a passive scalar in a cross-sectional plane can be single-or double-peaked, depending on the nozzle shape and orientation. A proper orthogonal decomposition of the transverse velocity indicates that coherent structures may be responsible for this phenomenon. Nozzles which have a single-peaked distribution have stronger modes in transverse direction. The global mixing performance is superior for these nozzle types. This is the case for the blunt square nozzle and for the elliptic nozzle with high aspect ratio. It is further demonstrated that the flow field contains large regions in which a passive scalar is transported up the mean gradient (counter-gradient transport) which implies failure of the gradient diffusion hypothesis.},

abstract = {This study characterizes the mixing performance and non-reacting injection flow field within a rotating detonation engine. Initial reactant mixing is accomplished through a counter-rotating vortex pair developing from a jet-in-a-crossflow situation. Radially injected air wraps around the fuel jet, shearing the hydrogen into the vortex structure. The three-dimensional baseline geometry produces poor hydrogen/air mixing in the injection zone due to low fuel penetration into the wide, cross-flowing air stream and low air entrainment into the vortex structure. Injection parameters, including reactant flow rate, injection area, and fuel injection distribution, are varied to assess the impact on mixing. Decreasing air injection area and fuel injection area improve fuel penetration into the air stream and the vortex mixing mechanism, enhancing the level of mixedness within the annulus. For a given air injection area, an optimized number of fuel injection holes exists that provides the greatest level of mixedness. Variations from the optimized geometry reduce the effectiveness of the vortex mixing mechanism. Staggering fuel injection holes produces a decrease in mixedness when compared to collinear fuel injection.},
